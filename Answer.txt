Exercise 1:
This program uses fork() to create a new process. 
If pid == 0  its a child process.
If pid > 0 its  a parent process.
If pid < 0 its a fork failed.

Role of the Linker:
The linker combines multiple object files (.o) into a single executable,It resolves external function references and arranges memory section.

the Loader:
The loader loads the executable into memory, maps shared libraries,sets up the stack, and transfers control to the program entry point.

Exercise 5:
file1.c defines hello()
file2.c declares hello() and calls it.
The linker connects them so main() can call hello().

Exercise 6:
ldd simple_program shows which shared libraries the program uses.
Examples: libc.so, ld-linux, etc.
